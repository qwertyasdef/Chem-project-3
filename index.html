        <h1>Chemical equilibrium</h1>
        <p>
            In chemistry, reactions don't always proceed to the end. Sometimes, they get stuck in the middle. This is called
            <b>equilibrium</b>, and it happens for reactions that occur in both directions. When a reaction is in equilibrium, the
            concentrations of the compounds remain the same. This is because the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the
            reverse reaction, so there is no net change in concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rate at which a reaction occurs depends on the concentration of the reactants, the temperature of the reaction, the
            physical state of the reactants, and the presence of a catalyst. For the one-step reaction
            <span class="equation">
                <i>n</i>A + <i>m</i>B &#8644; <i>p</i>C + <i>q</i>D
            </span>
            where A, B, C, and D are all gases or solutions, the forward rate can be written as
            <span class="equation">
                k<sub>1</sub>[A]<sup><i>n</i></sup>[B]<sup><i>m</i></sup>
            </span>
            and the reverse rate as
            <span class="equation">
                k<sub>2</sub>[C]<sup><i>p</i></sup>[D]<sup><i>q</i></sup>
            </span>
            Since the forward rate and the reverse rate are equal at equilibrium, the ratio of the reverse rate to the forward rate is
            one to one. From this, we can rearrange to find
            <span class="equation">
                <span class="fraction">
                    k<sub>2</sub>[C]<sup><i>p</i></sup>[D]<sup><i>q</i></sup>
                    <line></line>
                    k<sub>1</sub>[A]<sup><i>n</i></sup>[B]<sup><i>m</i></sup>
                </span>
                = 1
                <br /><br />
                <span class="fraction">
                    [C]<sup><i>p</i></sup>[D]<sup><i>q</i></sup>
                    <line></line>
                    [A]<sup><i>n</i></sup>[B]<sup><i>m</i></sup>
                </span>
                =
                <span class="fraction">
                    k<sub>1</sub>
                    <line></line>
                    k<sub>2</sub>
                </span>
            </span>
            The expression on the left is called the <b>equilibrium expression</b>, and the value on the right,
            <span class="fraction">k<sub>1</sub><line></line>k<sub>2</sub></span> is a constant, which we call the
            <b>equilibrium constant</b>, or K<sub>eq</sub>. It is important to note that the equilibrium expression is only equal to the
            equilibrium constant when the reaction has reached equilibrium.

        <h2>Le Chatelier's Principle</h2>
        <p>
        	Le Chatelier's principle is that: if a system at equilibrium is disturbed, the system will shift its equilibrium
            position so as to counter the effect of the disturbance. This can be explained in terms of
            <b>kinetic molecular theory</b> by examining the effect that each disturbance has on the collisions taking place
            in the reaction, and how that affects the forwards and backwards reaction rates of the equilibrium reaction. Le
            Chatelier's principle can be applied to the following four factors.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            	<b>Concentration:</b>
                <p>
                    Adding or removing a reactant or product. If a chemical system is already at equilibrium and
                    the concentration of any substance in the mixture is increased (either reactant or product), the system reacts to
                    consume some of that substance. Conversely, if the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system reacts to
                    produce some of that substance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By adding more reactants or products to the reaction, the frequency of collisions between reactant or product molecules
                    increases. This gives more opportunities for the forwards or backwards reaction to occur, speeding up the respective
                    rate and shifting equilibrium the other way. Similarly, reducing the concentration reduces the number of collisions
                    and slows down the rate in one direction causing the equilibrium to shift towards the slower rate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            	<b>Pressure:</b>
                <p>
                    Changing the pressure by changing the volume. Reducing the volume of a gaseous equilibrium mixture causes the system
                    to shift in the direction that reduces the number of moles of gas. Increasing the volume of a gaseous equilibrium mixture
                    causes the sytem to shift in the direction that increases the number of moles of gas. Note that changing the total pressure
                    by adding a non-reacting gas to the system does <b>not</b> affect equilibrium. This is because the partial pressure of the
                    reactants and products remain unchanged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the partial pressures of the reacting gases are increased, the number of collisions for both products and reactants
                    increases, but it increases more for the side with more moles of gas. This increases the reaction rate for the side with
                    more moles of gas and causes the equilibrium to shift to the other side. Decreasing the pressure has the opposite effect.
                    Adding a non-reacting gas has no effect because it changes the rate of collisions between both the reactants and the products
                    by the same amount, leading to no net shift.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Temperature:</b>
                <p>
                	Increasing or decreasing the reaction temperature. When the temperature of a system at equilibrium is increased, the
                    system reacts as if we added a reactant to an endothermic reaction or a product to an exothermic reaction. The
                    equilibrium shifts in the direction that consumes the excess reactant (or product), namely heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of all particles is higher, so the number of collisions in which
                    the particles have enough energy to react is higher. This speeds up the rate in both directions, but the increase is greater
                    for endothermic reactions than exothermic reactions so the equilibrium shifts to consume heat. The opposite is true for
                    decreasing the temperature.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Catalyst:</b>
                <p>
                	Adding or removing a catalyst. A catalyst increases the rate at which equilibrium is achieved but does not change the
                    composition of the equilibrium mixture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of a reaction so that more collisions are energetic enough to react,
                    but it does so equally in both directions. Both rates increase the same amount, so there is no net shift in equilibrium.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
